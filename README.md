# SIT320 - Group 21

Our project is to create a **Smart Pot Plant system** which brings ease to planting!

The pot plant is able to detect the Temperature and Moisture of the plant, 
and show the data to the user through an UI.

The user is also able to change the Temperature and Moisture value,
raising or lowering them depending on the situation.
